I am a first-year PhD student advised by [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/), my field of study being differential privacy and differential privacy applied to various learning settings. My main interests are understanding the usefulness and the shortcomings of private learning against instantiable adversaries. I am also interested in making private learning algorithms with reasonable privacy-utility tradeoffs.

I hold a MSc degree with honours from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (ENSL), supervised by [Sonia Ben Mokhtar](https://sites.google.com/view/sonia-benmokhtar/accueil) and [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/), [Mohamed Mauche](https://mmaouche.github.io/) and [Vlad Nitu](https://sites.google.com/view/vnitu/).  My thesis topic was to work on adversaries that exploit learning mistakes, turning misclassifications into low-cost membership inference attacks.

I want to highlight my work in the OpenMined community, where in the last two years, I worked on the development of PySyft. Working on PySyft offered the opportunity to do high-quality open source engineering, learn how to work in a small team of dedicated people and get a strong grasp on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. The experience at OpenMined is invaluable for my further research, as I understood from a hands-on perspective the current limitations of creating a decentralized collaborative learning system that allows byzantine faults.

Before ENSL, I received a computer science engineering degree from Politehnica University of Bucharest. My bachelor thesis is a Reinforcement Learning simulator supervised by Matei Popovici. While obtaining my degree, I did a few industry internships on various topics related to machine learning: reinforcement learning on graphs, recommender systems, generative computer vision for errors correction and anomaly detection.
