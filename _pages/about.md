👋 I am first-year PhD student at Inria 🇫🇷, supervised by Aurélien Bellet. Currently, I am a research intern at the Vector Institute 🇨🇦 hosted by Nicolas Papernot.

🔍 **Research & Interests**: I am interested in differential privacy (DP) and its applications in making useful machine learning models with privacy guarantees. More generally, I am interested in (provable) AI safety.

🎓 **Education**: I hold a MSc in Theoretical Computer Science from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon 🇫🇷 and an EECS degree from Politehnica University of Bucharest 🇷🇴.

❤️ **Open Source**: Currently, I lead an open-source privacy enhancing technologies research group at OpenMined, coordinating a dynamic team of 40+ members. From monthly gatherings to reading seminars and research presentations, our goal is to lower the entry-barrier to research in privacy-related topics. Before that, I wore the presidential hat at Romanian Open Source Educational (ROSEdu), organizing courses, summer schools, and meetings about open source for the students at Politehnica University of Bucharest.
