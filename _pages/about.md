👋 I am first-year PhD student at Inria 🇫🇷, mentored by Aurélien Bellet. Currently, I am a research intern at the Vector Institute 🇨🇦 hosted by Nicolas Papernot.

🔍 Research & Interests: I am interested in differential privacy (DP) and its applications in making useful machine learning models with privacy guarantees.

🎓 Educational Pathway: I hold a MSc in Theoretical Computer Science from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon 🇫🇷 and an EECS degree from Politehnica University of Bucharest 🇷🇴.

❤️ Open Source: Currently, I lead an open-source privacy enhancing technologies research group at OpenMined, coordinating a dynamic team of 40+ members. From monthly gatherings to reading seminars and research presentations, our goal is to lower the entry-barrier to research in privacy-related topics. Flashback to my past, I wore the presidential hat at ROmanian Open Source Educational (ROSEdu), organizing courses, summer schools, and meetings for the students at Politehnica University of Bucharest.
