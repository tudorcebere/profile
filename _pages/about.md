I am a soon-to-graduate MSc. student from Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon (ENSL), co-supervised by [Sonia Ben Mokhtar](https://sites.google.com/view/sonia-benmokhtar/accueil) and [Aurelien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/). My main interests are understanding the usefulness and the shortcomings of private learning against instantiable adversaries. The topic of my thesis is to work on adversaries that exploit mistakes made at training time, turning misclassifications into low-cost membership inference attacks. In general, I am passionate about Differential Privacy, and I am keen to explore different constructs or relaxations of DP tailored for Machine Learning purposes.

I want to highlight my work in the [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) community, where in the last two years, I worked on the development of PySyft. Working on PySyft offered the opportunity to do high-quality open source engineering, learn how to work in a small team of dedicated people and get a strong grasp on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. The experience at OpenMined is invaluable for my further research, as I understood from a hands-on perspective the current limitations of creating a decentralized collaborative learning system that allows byzantine faults.

Before ENSL, I received a computer science engineering degree from Politehnica University of Bucharest. My bachelor thesis is a simulator for Reinforcement 
Learning purposes, supervised by Matei Popovici. While obtaining my degree, I did a few internships on various topics related to machine learning: reinforcement learning on graphs, recommender systems, generative computer vision for errors correction and anomaly detection.
