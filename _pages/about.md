I am a first-year PhD student at Inria :france: advised by [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/) at Inria :france:. My research interests are differential privacy and differential privacy applied to various learning settings.  I hold a MSc in Theoretical Computer Science from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon :france: and an EECS degree from Politehnica University of Bucharest :romania:. In general, I am interested in (provable) privacy, (applied) cryptography and mathematics in general.

I have a strong preference for open source communities, currently I am leading an open source trustworthy-ML research group for OpenMined, with the goal of helping students connect with researchers and collaborate on topics like privacy, fairness, robustness for ML or privacy enhancing technologies in general. We are coordinating over 40 members, organizing monthly meetings, aperiodical reading seminars or research presentations. In the past, I have been the president of ROmanian :romania: Open Source Educational (ROSEdu), organizing meetings, courses and summer schools for the open source community at Politehnica University of Bucharest, impacting over 2000 students.


I did a few industry internships on various topics related to machine learning: reinforcement learning on graphs (ParisTech), recommender systems (UiPath), generative computer vision for errors correction (UiPath) and anomaly detection.
