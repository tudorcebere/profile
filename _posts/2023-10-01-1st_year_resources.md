During my EECS studies, I didn't get an introduction to many theoretical topics that are both interesting and extremely useful for my research. Here is an outline of the online courses I found interesting during my first year of PhD. Some of the courses I did not finish, or I did not need everything presented, but I found them very didactic.

To understand Differential Privacy and Machine Learning, the foundational understanding of probability must be pretty sound. I only had a measure-theoretic introduction to probability in the first year of PhD, but I recommend getting one as soon as possible. Afterwards, everything makes so much more sense. I have mixed multiple resources when learning measure-theoretic probability, but the most fundamental ones were:
 * [Stanford CS109](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4jXE-LdDTQq8ZyA8F8reSQHej3F6RFX) - A good refresher on probability
 * [The Bright Side of Mathematics Measure Theory course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2quIJS-j1NpbzEvQCmN00F5o): A nice introduction to measure theory and **why** to study it. My way of learning is to understand first why we must study something. This course covers all the whys well.
 * [Advanced probability course by Professor Lanchier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGsHiHwgInU&list=PLV3oHJg9b1NRhjCs7ZgkAj6US-8m2ymTB): An introduction to measure-theoretic probability with some simple examples and some of the essential proofs. Easy to follow and did not scare an engineer.
 * [Measure Theory by Claudio Landim](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4jXE-LdDTQq8ZyA8F8reSQHej3F6RFX): A more detailed introduction to measure theory.



The basic and the more advanced things I was studying would sometimes reference ideas from functional analysis, which I never had a course on. Looking back, I would first take a course in functional analysis and then study measure theory. While the notations/way of doing this is different, everything made sense in measure theory after studying functional analysis as well. 
* [The Bright Side of Mathematics Functional Analysis couse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDdxFBcvSGw&list=PLBh2i93oe2qsGKDOsuVVw-OCAfprrnGfr)
* [18.102 MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2021/video_galleries/lecture-videos/) - Still working on it, a fantastic course.


Now, we can wander into ways of applying these new tools. Some courses I have watched and enjoyed:
* [Markov Processes by J.N Corcoran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9otUB3WXB8E&list=PLLyj1Zd4UWrP3rME2XvFvE4Q5vI3H_7_Z): Easy to follow, introducing a lot of the fundamental tools in applied probability. Professor Corcoran is a great teacher!
* [Mathematical Statistics by J.N. Corcoran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELgjmaSGsWs&list=PLLyj1Zd4UWrOk5-wIki_oOxHJnNj0_437): Easy to follow, introduces estimators, confidence intervals, binary hypothesis, etc. The major downside of this course is that some courses need to be added.
* [High dimensional probability by R. Vershynin](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/teaching/hdp/hdp.html): Great course to understand plenty of tools in high dimensional probability. Maybe too much was covered, but it was fascinating, nonetheless.
* [Learning Theory by S.B. David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NlRg8SjZg&list=PLPW2keNyw-usgvmR7FTQ3ZRjfLs5jT4BO): For learning theory people this course needs no introduction. Great introduction to theoretical machine learning.
* [Large Scale Machine Learning by R. Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/STA4273_2015/): Another great course in theoretical machine learning.


I never had an introduction to information theory in my undergrad either, yet some notions from IT emerged in machine learning and differential privacy. I followed this course and enjoyed it:
* [Information Theory, pattern recognition and neural networks by D. MacKay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6)


In the end, I will add the courses that study some of the things I am interested in:
* [Differential Privacy by G. Kamath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJMjNOcIqkc&list=PLmd_zeMNzSvRRNpoEWkVo6QY_6rR3SHjp): One of a kind introduction in differential privacy!
* [Sketching Algorithms by J. Nelson](https://sketchingbigdata.org/fall20/lec/): Highly didactic introduction in sketching techniques.


I found out after starting my PhD that a significant component of the PhD life is writing. Here are some resources that I found helpful in writing:
* [The Elements of Style](https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/the-elements-of-style)
* [How to write a great paper by S.P Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/)

I am a big fan of [Oded Goldreich](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/on-ideas.html). His books and blog posts are a mine of gold, yet I will only highlight two of them
* [How to write a paper by O Goldreich](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/writing.html)
* [On the emotional difficulty of conducting research by O. Goldreich](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/on-ideas.html)
